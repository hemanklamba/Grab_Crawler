# Grab_Crawler
This is primarily a crawler that uses to grab details by filling up a form.

Ideally it should work for all the government employees contact information websites.
We tested it out on a specific website on gsa.gov

But the technique being used could be easily transferable to any other website.

Requirements:
1. Python 2.7(preferable Anaconda) 
2. Grab Library Python (It is supposedly a Russian developers based Python library; but it is pretty sweet, works amazing and simplistic to understand)
3. BeautifulSoup (To make sense of all those pages).
